# What is BEX? üêª ‚õìÔ∏è

BEX (Berachain Exchange) is the native decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol of Berachain, enabling trading of any arbitrary pair of crypto assets without the need for intermediaries.

## How BEX Works ‚öôÔ∏è

BEX is powered by an AMM. Buy and sell orders in traditional order book markets are instead replaced with liquidity pools of different pairs of assets. As one asset is traded for the other, the relative prices of the two assets shift, and a new market rate for both is determined.

BEX is run entirely within a single smart contract, making BEX extremely efficient and lightweight. The design of BEX is inspired by the innovations pioneered by [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/).

## Key Features

BEX's architecture choices confer a number of core advantages over other DEXs:

- Accommodates traditional full-range liquidity pools (i.e., "Uniswap V2 style"), providing a simple and efficient trading experience
- Supports custom weights such as 80/20 for customized exposure
- Supports stable swap curves for trading pegged assets
- Unified vault architecture increases capital efficiency and gas costs
